| EMPIRE      | NTNU               | Optimize power plants operation and investments in power generation and transmission capacity              | EMPIRE incorporates long-term and short-term system dynamics, while optimizing investments under operational uncertainty. By decoupling the optimization of system operation at each investment period from future investment in transmission infrastructure and operation periods, a computationally tractable optimization problem is produced                        | Finished           |
| e-Transport | SINTEF             | Optimal operation and investment path for energy systems over a planning horizon of several decades to bring available energy to the end user             | It optimizes investments in infrastructure over a planning horizon of several decades to bring available energy to the end user in such quantities and in such form that the end users demand is covered in the economically and environmentally best way possible. As part of the investment analysis, however, the model also optimizes diurnal operation for different periods of the year for each alternative system design. This operational module can be run independently from the investment module.                       | Finished           |
| EXIOMOD     | TNO                | Measure the environmental and economic impacts of policies                | Thanks to its environmental extensions, see www.em-plus.eu, it establishes the link between the economic activities of various agents and the use of a large number of resources and negative externalities (greenhouse gases, wastes)                         | Finished           |
| FanSi       | SINTEF             | Long-to-medium term operation of hydrothermal power systems             | Optimal dispatch of hydrothermal power systems considering stochastic climate variables such as wind, solar, inflow to hydropower reservoirs and river network topology                      | Finished           |
| FRESH:COM   | TU WIEN            | Dimension/design and consider the actors’ sharing allocation preferences in different local energy community configurations            | Based on this model, different allocation and clearing mechanisms of shared local generation among the individual actors can be considered: static (individual actor’s optimum according to predefined allocation scheme) and dynamic (hourly/real time global community optimum exploiting several synergies among actors’ load profiles and preferences)                     | Finished           |
| GENeSYS-MOD | TU Berlin          | Optimize least-cost configuration and operation           | To achieve a cost-optimal energy mix, the model considers a plethora of different technology options, including generation, sector coupling, and storage. Moreover, by allowing for different emission targets (such as emission budgets, yearly emission targets, or emission reduction goals), possible cost-minimizing pathways towards a largely (or even fully) decarbonized energy system can be analyzed                   | Under development  |
| HERO        | TU WIEN            | Optimal investment and dispatch of distributed generation and battery storage             | Optimal capacity allocation and dispatch (distributed generation and battery storage) under special consideration of sector coupling on distribution grid level (electricity, heating/ cooling and gas grid) for meeting the energy services needs of local energy communities                     | Finished           |
| openTEPES   | COMILLAS           | Determine the investments plans of new facilities for supplying the forecasted demand at minimum cost           | Multicriteria: the objective function incorporates some of the main quantifiable objectives: generation and transmission investment cost (CAPEX) and expected variable operation costs (including generation emission cost) (system OPEX). The operation model is a network constrained unit commitment (NCUC) including operating reserves with a DC power flow (DCPF) through a detailed power network      | Under development  |
| OSCARS      | TU WIEN            | Optimal utilization of small battery storage systems at prosumer level            | The main task is to maximize the profit for a balancing responsible party under consideration of optimal operational dispatch of battery storage and flexible loads. This includes (i) the minimization of the scheduling forecast deviation of balancing responsible parties (and thus reduction of balancing energy), (ii) the provision of ancillary services to the TSO and (iii) excess energy sold to the wholesale market                     | Finished           |
| Plan4EU     | EDF                | i)Optimal capacity expansion, ii)Optimal operation of seasonal storage, and iii)Economic dispatch at European level                | The plan4eu modelling suite is focused on the electricity system, comprises i) a capacity expansion model which finds the best optimal compromise between generation/storage investment and transmission/distribution expansion for a given long-term horizon, ii) a seasonal storage valuation tool and iii) a European operational dispatch model. All 3 models include uncertainties, a realistic accounting of all technical costs and constraints including system services, for all kinds of centralized and distributed assets. It includes an aggregated modelling of transmission and distribution networks                         | Under development  |
| REMES-EU    | NTNU SINTEF        | Study the effects of macroeconomic policies on the EU economy        | A basic equilibrium is provided in the input data (called Social Accounting Matrix). Any change to the basic equilibrium is a shock, and the model recalculates the variables according to the flexibility of the production processes for all sectors                 | Finished           |
| SCOPE-SD    | Fraunhofer IEE     | Cross-sectoral capacity expansion planning and economic dispatch optimization for developing long-term, low-carbon energy scenarios     | Thanks to the hourly modeling of the supply and demand characteristics of a scenario year, it is possible to model both the renewable energy producers and conventional power plants, as well as the use of storage technologies and flexibility options, in detail. A wide variety of conventional and renewable generation technologies are available for power generation. The necessary flexibility for the integration of renewable power generation is modeled using various storage technologies, load management options, and European cross-border exchanges of energy. Depending on the research question, the heat and transport sector, with their interfaces with the power sector, can be modeled with a high degree of temporal and spatial detail              | Finished           |
