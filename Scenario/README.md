| CS1   | Case Study 1: Demand response – the behavior of individuals     | It will evaluate the potential flexibility from demand response from household consumers and study its impact on the integrated European electricity system cost, operation, and investment needs.                                                                                               |
| CS2   | Case Study 2: Communities of actors                          | It will study shared energy management in different local energy community concepts, taking into account the individual preferences of the actors involved. Based on comprehensive modeling, the quantitative results will be up-scaled on the country and the European level.                        |
| CS3   | Case Study 3 - Need for flexibility: Storage                 | It will analyze how the uses of flexible hydropower and more generally of different kinds of storages (pumped-hydro, batteries, gas….) can tackle some of the main challenges of the energy transition.                                                                                          |
| CS4   | Case Study 4 – Need for flexibility: Sector coupling         | It will be dedicated to cross-sector integration, with a specific focus on the flexibilities provided by electric vehicle owners to the electricity system.                                                                                                                                      |
| CS5   | Case Study 5 - Decentralization                              | It will compare different levels of geographic coordination for investment decisions, both at the regional and European levels, focusing on the topic of decentralization. In particular regional decisions with local objectives will be compared with national or European coordinated decisions.   |
| CS6   | Case Study 6 – Innovative Technologies                       | It will analyze the use of innovative technology in terms of underground rocks for seasonal storage of heat from summer to winter in a district in Oslo, Norway. The analyses will show the impact on the energy system in the district. Relevance for other European regions will be discussed. |
| CS7   | Case Study 7 – Integration of electricity and heating sector | It will evaluate how the use of flexibilities from the heating sector at different time scales (short-time planning with hourly to 5 minutes resolution) may have an impact on the system operation costs and network expansion needs.                                                           |
| CS8   | Case Study 8 - Gas storage for flexibility                   | It will investigate the role of natural gas storage in current and future energy systems in transition.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| CS9   | Case Study 9 - Effective policies for investment incentives  | It will address regulatory barriers and market design options in shaping the future energy system.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
